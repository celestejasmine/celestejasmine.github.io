This is beaded artwork. The design was created by pixelating an image of the crab nebula eated by superimposing different wavelengths of light. It won an honourable mention at [McGill SciArt200](https://reporter.mcgill.ca/sciart200-winners-announced/), an art competition organized to celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of McGill University.
