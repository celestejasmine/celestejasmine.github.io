This semester, I am doing a project on causal inference for online controlled experiments (A/B tests). Particular challenges I focus on in my literature review include detecting small treatment effects, detecting long-term treatment effects, detecting heterogeneous treatment effects, and inference under network interference. I will share my literature review once it is ready next month.
